👋 Hi there! My name is Chuyang Xiao. I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in computer science at **ShanghaiTech University**. Currently, I have joined the 4DV Lab, under the mentorship of Prof. Yuexin Ma. During 2023-2024 academic year, I was an exchange student at **University of California Berkeley**.
I will be joining the **MSR** program at **Carnegie Mellon University** in Fall 2025. 🌻

## News:
- **[Jan.2025]** One paper has been accepted by 2025 ICRA conference.🤖
- **[Dec.2024]** Triple Excellence Student 2023-2024 of ShanghaiTech Unversity 🌸
- **[Oct.2024]** I was awarded National Scholarship (TOP 0.4% Student in China) for the 2023-2024 Academic Year.🎉 🙏
- **[Jun.2024]** I was awarded by ShanghaiTech International Exchange Program Scholarship, received 100,000 RMB (≈13,700 USD).💰
- **[Apr.2024]** One paper has been accepted by 2024 CVPR workshop.🌹
- **[Dec.2023]** Merit Student 2022-2023 of ShanghaiTech Unversity 🌸

## Research Experience
- **[Oct.2024 - Feb.2025]** Created the first dataset and evaluation benchmark for dynamic grasping with a dexterous hand, and implemented our own approach combining diffusion models and other models, such as GOAL, for the task. 🦾
- **[May.2024 - Sep.2024]** Developed a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method to optimize traffic flow in intersections with varying topologies. Created a new benchmark for mixed traffic research.🚗
- **[Jun.2024 - Jul.2024]** Trained image classification tasks using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) as a visual encoder for robotic manipulation tasks.🤖
- **[Mar.2024 - Apr.2024]** Assessed current text-to-video models with a focus on their handling of temporal input data.⌚️
- **[Apr.2023 - Jun.2023]** Built multi-modal dataloaders for training a human-position estimation model. Conducted parameter fitting for mesh models.
