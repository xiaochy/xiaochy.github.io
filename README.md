👋 Hi there! My name is Chuyang Xiao. I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in computer science at **ShanghaiTech University**. Currently, I have joined the 4DV Lab, under the mentorship of Prof. Yuexin Ma. During 2023-2024 academic year, I was an exchange student at **University of California Berkeley**.

## News:
- **[Oct.2024]** I was awarded Shanghai Municipal Scholarship for the 2023-2024 Academic Year.🎉
- **[Sep.2024]** One paper has been submitted to 2025 ICRA conference. 🙏
- **[Jun.2024]** I was awarded by ShanghaiTech International Exchange Program Scholarship, received 100,000 RMB (≈13,700 USD).💰
- **[Apr.2024]** One paper has been accepted by 2024 CVPR workshop.🌹

## Research Experience
- **[May.2024 - Sep.2024]** Developed a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method to optimize traffic flow in intersections with varying topologies. Created a new benchmark for mixed traffic research.🚗
- **[Jun.2024 - Jul.2024]** Trained image classification tasks using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) as a visual encoder for robotic manipulation tasks.🤖
- **[Mar.2024 - Apr.2024]** Assessed current text-to-video models with a focus on their handling of temporal input data.⌚️
- **[Apr.2023 - Jun.2023]** Built multi-modal dataloaders for training a human-position estimation model. Conducted parameter fitting for mesh models.
